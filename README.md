This is a docker file that utilizes [mjpg-streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer)‚Å† to stream a webcam through the local network. You can find the docker image pre-build for AMD64 adn ARM64 processors on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mnapps/mjpeg-streamer/tags).

Proposed docker-compose file (I used this config with a PS3 eye camera):

      mjpg-streamer:
        restart: always
